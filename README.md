# Fitness tracker

## what is this?
This is an API that is designed to be used for tracking a user's run. It can add, delete, upload and view information regarding a user, given a password, username, and/or other functions. There is simple UI, and can be run using the curl command

## Why did I make this?
I really enjoy making APIs, taking items from one part of the internet and combining them with others. In this case, it was combining a database and my own server to work in tandom. I hope you guys enjoy this project just as much as I do!
